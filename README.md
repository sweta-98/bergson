# Bergson
Bergson is a python library which provides scalable, state-of-the-art influence functions for large language models, including  [EK-FAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03296) (2023), [TrackStar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17413v3) (2024), and [Magic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16430) (2025), alongside simple baselines such as gradient cosine similarity.

Influence functions trade off usefulness for costliness. Our most costly and powerful method, MAGIC, uses 3-5x the compute of training a single model to produce per-token or per-sequence scores that correlate with the effects of leave-k-out retraining at ρ=0.9 or higher. Faster methods like EK-FAC and TrackStar run at less than the cost of training the attributed model on the dataset of interest, but tend to correlate with leave-k-out retraining at ρ=0.3 or lower and may be more profitably modeled as corresponding to the [proximal Bregman response function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05364).

## Core features

- Gradient store for serial queries. We provide collection-time gradient compression for efficient storage, and integrate with FAISS for fast KNN search over large stores.
- On-the-fly queries. Query gradients without disk I/O overhead via a single pass over a dataset with a set of precomputed query gradients.
  - Experiment with multiple query strategies based on [LESS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04333).
  - Ideal for compression-free gradients.
- Per-token scores.
- Train‑time gradient collection. Capture gradients produced during training with a ~17% performance overhead.
- Scalable. We use [FSDP2](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html), BitsAndBytes, and other performance optimizations to support large models, datasets, and clusters.
- Integrated with HuggingFace Transformers and Datasets. We also support on-disk datasets in a variety of formats.
- Structured gradient views and per-attention head gradient collection. Bergson enables mechanistic interpretability via easy access to per‑module or per-attention head gradients.

```

# Quickstart

To construct an index of randomly projected gradients:

```bash
bergson build runs/index --model EleutherAI/pythia-14m --dataset NeelNanda/pile-10k --truncation --token_batch_size 4096
```

To collect Trackstar attribution scores:

```bash
bergson trackstar runs/trackstar --model EleutherAI/pythia-14m --query.dataset NeelNanda/pile-10k --data.dataset NeelNanda/pile-10k --data.truncation --token_batch_size 4096 --query.truncation --query.split "train[:20]"
```

To use MAGIC on a GPT-2 WikiText fine-tune:

```bash
bergson magic examples/magic/gpt2_wikitext_tiny.yaml
```

# Usage

There are two ways to use Bergson. The first is to write an index of dataset gradients to disk using `build` then query it programmatically or using the `Attributor` or `query` CLI. The second is to specify your query upfront, then map over the dataset and collect and process gradients on the fly. When using this second strategy only influence scores will be saved.

You can build an index of gradients for each training sample from the command line, using `bergson` as a CLI tool:

```bash
bergson build <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name>
```

This will create a directory at `<output_path>` containing the gradients for each training sample in the specified dataset. The `--model` and `--dataset` arguments should be compatible with the Hugging Face `transformers` library. By default it assumes that the dataset has a `text` column, but you can specify other columns using `--prompt_column` and optionally `--completion_column`. The `--help` flag will show you all available options.

You can also use the library programmatically to build an index. The `collect_gradients` function is just a bit lower level the CLI tool, and allows you to specify the model and dataset directly as arguments. The result is a HuggingFace dataset which contains a handful of new columns, including `gradients`, which contains the gradients for each training sample. You can then use this dataset to compute attributions.

At the lowest level of abstraction, the `GradientCollector` context manager allows you to efficiently collect gradients for _each individual example_ in a batch during a backward pass, simultaneously randomly projecting the gradients to a lower-dimensional space to save memory. If you use Adafactor normalization we will do this in a very compute-efficient way which avoids computing the full gradient for each example before projecting it to the lower dimension. There are two main ways you can use `GradientCollector`:

1. Using a `closure` argument, which enables you to make use of the per-example gradients immediately after they are computed, during the backward pass. If you're computing summary statistics or other per-example metrics, this is the most efficient way to do it.
2. Without a `closure` argument, in which case the gradients are collected and returned as a dictionary mapping module names to batches of gradients. This is the simplest and most flexible approach but is a bit more memory-intensive.

## On-the-fly Query

You can score a large dataset against a previously built query index without saving its gradients to disk:

```bash
bergson score <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name> --query_path <existing_index_path> --score individual --aggregation mean
```

We provide a utility to reduce a dataset into its mean or sum query gradient, for use as a query index:

```bash
bergson reduce <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name> --aggregation mean --unit_normalize
```

## Index Query

We provide a query Attributor which supports unit normalized gradients and KNN search out of the box. Access it via CLI with

```bash
bergson query --index  <index_path> --model <model_name> --unit_norm
```

or programmatically with

```python
from bergson import Attributor, FaissConfig

attr = Attributor(args.index, device="cuda")

...
query_tokens = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")["input_ids"]

# Query the index
with attr.trace(model.base_model, 5) as result:
    model(query_tokens, labels=query_tokens).loss.backward()
    model.zero_grad()
```

To efficiently query on-disk indexes, perform ANN searches, and explore many other scalability features add a FAISS config:

```python
attr = Attributor(args.index, device="cuda", faiss_cfg=FaissConfig("IVF1,SQfp16", mmap_index=True))

with attr.trace(model.base_model, 5) as result:
    model(query_tokens, labels=query_tokens).loss.backward()
    model.zero_grad()
```

## Training Gradients

Gradient collection during training is supported via an integration with HuggingFace's Trainer and SFTTrainer classes. Training gradients are saved in the original order corresponding to their dataset items, and when the `track_order` flag is set the training steps associated with each training item are separately saved.

```python
from bergson import GradientCollectorCallback, prepare_for_gradient_collection

callback = GradientCollectorCallback(
    path="runs/example",
    track_order=True,
)
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    eval_dataset=dataset,
    callbacks=[callback],
)
trainer = prepare_for_gradient_collection(trainer)
trainer.train()
```

## Attention Head Gradients

By default Bergson collects gradients for named parameter matrices, but per-attention head gradients may be collected by configuring an AttentionConfig for each module of interest.

```python
from bergson import AttentionConfig, IndexConfig, DataConfig
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("RonenEldan/TinyStories-1M", trust_remote_code=True, use_safetensors=True)

collect_gradients(
    model=model,
    data=data,
    processor=processor,
    path="runs/split_attention",
    attention_cfgs={
        # Head configuration for the TinyStories-1M transformer
        "h.0.attn.attention.out_proj": AttentionConfig(num_heads=16, head_size=4, head_dim=2),
    },
)
```

## GRPO

Where a reward signal is available we compute gradients using a weighted advantage estimate based on Dr. GRPO:

```bash
bergson build <output_path> --model <model_name> --dataset <dataset_name> --reward_column <reward_column_name>
```

## Numerical Stability

Some models produce inconsistent per-example gradients when batched together. This is caused by nondeterminism in optimized SDPA attention backends (flash, memory-efficient) — the diagnostic tests both padding-induced and equal-length batch divergence to pinpoint the source.

Use the built-in diagnostic to check your model:

```bash
bergson test_model_configuration --model <model_name>
```

This automatically tests escalating configurations and reports exactly which flags (if any) you need:

```bash
# If force_math_sdp alone is sufficient:
bergson build <output_path> --model <model_name> --force_math_sdp
# If fp32 with TF32 matmuls is sufficient (cheaper than full fp32):
bergson build <output_path> --model <model_name> --precision fp32 --use_tf32_matmuls --force_math_sdp
# If full fp32 precision is required:
bergson build <output_path> --model <model_name> --precision fp32 --force_math_sdp
```

### Performance impact

Benchmarked on A100-80GB with 500 documents from pile-10k:

| Model | Settings | Build time | vs bf16 baseline |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Pythia-160M | bf16 | 31.2s | — |
| Pythia-160M | bf16 + `--force_math_sdp` | 31.0s | -0.7% |
| Pythia-160M | fp32 + `--use_tf32_matmuls` | 26.6s | -14.7% |
| Pythia-160M | fp32 + `--use_tf32_matmuls` + `--force_math_sdp` | 27.5s | -11.9% |
| Pythia-160M | fp32 | 35.4s | +13.3% |
| Pythia-160M | fp32 + `--force_math_sdp` | 40.6s | +29.9% |
| OLMo-2-1B | bf16 | 45.5s | — |
| OLMo-2-1B | bf16 + `--force_math_sdp` | 53.9s | +18.4% |
| OLMo-2-1B | fp32 + `--use_tf32_matmuls` | 51.3s | +12.7% |
| OLMo-2-1B | fp32 + `--use_tf32_matmuls` + `--force_math_sdp` | 54.0s | +18.8% |
| OLMo-2-1B | fp32 | 131.8s | +189.8% |
| OLMo-2-1B | fp32 + `--force_math_sdp` | 141.2s | +210.5% |

`--use_tf32_matmuls` with fp32 precision is significantly cheaper than full fp32 and may be sufficient for many models.

Not all models are affected — run `bergson test_model_configuration` before enabling these flags to avoid unnecessary overhead.
